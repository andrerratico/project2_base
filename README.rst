CSC410 Fall 2017 : Project 2 starter pack
=========================================
Getting started
---------------
Have a look at  p2parsers/parallelAssignmentParser.py.
The file parses a parallel assignment into a list of strings and a list of S-expressions.
S-expressions are represented a nested lists, you will need to transform this raw format,
but you have at least a starting point. All the parsing you will ever need to do is already
done, you just need to handle several tasks yourselves now:
- creating a representation to manipulate expression that is better than nested-lists. An AST
would be a good idea.
- and all the other requirements of the project!
